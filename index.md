Beschreibung:
In this seminar, we will discuss recent developments in psycholinguistic models of speech production and comprehension; specifically how these processes interact and unfold in real time conversation (dialogue). We will discuss various models of predictive speech planning and predictive processing and how these can account for turn-taking gaps in dialogue. Besides reading and summarizing various research articles, student will analyze and transcribe spoken language corpora and will use these transcription to help form hypothesis and find experimental materials for designing experiments.

Goals
Here we will try to address several fundamental research questions:
- can pause/gap lengths be linked to general and specific production and comprehension processes?
- do gaps/pauses give rise to additional information, e.g. pragmatic inferences/implicatures (“awkward pause”) or is this more of a constraint on “expectation” based inferences
- do people expect certain pause lengths based on the information request and/or social factors?


The seminar has the following (pedagogical) goals:
provide an overview of the literature on turn-taking and pauses
generate critical discussion of fundamental research questions (can pauses/gaps be linked to production/comprehension processes? when do pauses become awkward?, etc.)
familiarize students with dialogue transcription Praat as well as scripting in Praat
show students how to adapt spontaneous utterances from corpora and developing them into items for an experiment.  
teach student how to create experiments using experimental items from real dialogue and why this is important. 

Literatur:
Students are responsible for reading the essential literature as quickly as possible. This will allow students to better follow the lectures. Students are also responsible for reaching the literature on specific topics covered in lecture. Suggested readings should be integrated in students’ Hausarbeit und group projects. All students will need to read this paper, but demonstrate a satisfactory understanding of the paper prior to class. There will also be several suggested papers that will be useful for formulating ideas about your project. Lectures will also include some of the suggested readings. 

Teilnahmebedingungen (participation requirements/grading): 
1) Klausur/Hausarbeit/Mündliche Prüfung 
If students choose to be evaluated by either a Klausur or Mündliche Prüfung, the will need to pick 4 topics and have proficient understanding of the literature in that topic regardless if the literature was covered in lecture. .  

2) Corpus analysis/group projects
Students will break up into groups (2-3) and corpora for gap length (pauses) and information requests (question type, response type, etc.). Groups will first present how they transcribed the corpus and discuss both positive and negative aspects of their work. Students will then work together and attempt to establish patterns in their data and develop these into testable hypotheses, which can be addressed through and experiment. 

3) Discussion questions (10% of grade)- students need to prepare 2 questions for the required reading for each lecture. I suggest that in your questions that you think about ways in which some of the ideas and claims could be tested empirically. Other questions can also express skepticism about the relationship between the evidence provided in the paper and the resulting claims or insights from other languages. Last, if students do no understand specific aspects of the reading, they should write down this question and ask it in class. 

For students only wanting a “Teilnahmbescheinigung”, you will only need to participant in doing the corpus analyses, group project, and submit discussion questions. 


Git hub:
Here we will provide the readings as well as various scripts for running the online experiment and conducting statistical analyses. Students will also submit various documents. The link can be found here:
